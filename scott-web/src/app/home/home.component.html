        Some projects are complete, but most are a work in progress; as I will always be adding some sort of feature or update to them.
        &nbsp;It's a lot of fun creating & building these projects and then seeing how people interact with them. &nbsp;If you have any 
        suggestions or improvements for me, feel free to email me at <a href id="email" mailto="JoshScott82@gmail.com">JoshScott82@gmail.com.</a>

                        I started working on this app to help solve the current issue in my household of; what do we have for dinner? &nbsp; We have
                        three kids, who seem to change what they like to eat on a daily basis and never unanimously agree on a meal. &nbsp;I will be using 
                        this to enter in what they like to eat and find some form of consesus or at least a plan of action for the week. &nbsp;
                        This is a work in progress and is not yet complete. &nbsp;I am actively working on building the app and will provide updates consistently.
                        &nbsp; The menu is hoverable in this one and on the left side of the screen. &nbsp;This app uses SQL database, C# backend (also built in Java),
                        and Angular for the front end.

                        <span>Here you can review an example Purchase Request System (PRS), that uses SQL, C# and Java backends, & Angular to create and store 
                        purchase requests, vendors, users, specific products and the request lines. &nbsp;The Guest login allows you to view the 
                        system, but limits the ability to make any changes or updates. &nbsp;If you would like to use an Admin login to view the entire
                        system, please contact me and I will provide one upon request. &nbsp;When logged in as an Admin you have the ability to add, remove, update,
                        and delete all information in the system. &nbsp;This makes calls to the SQL database to perform those specific functions. </span>

                        Pazaak card game from Star Wars or the work in progress battle system. &nbsp;This is currently setup as a console app in C# & Visual Studio 2022; 
                        however, I am learning to utilize Unity and Unreal Engine, so I will be able to transfer it over with graphics in the future. 
                        &nbsp;Pazaak is currently in the Casino area along with a couple slot machines and blackjack to increase your credits to buy one 
                        of the ships in the Ship Bazaar. &nbsp;This currently links to my GitHub where you can browse the code or download it and play 
                        the game with visual studio.</span>
